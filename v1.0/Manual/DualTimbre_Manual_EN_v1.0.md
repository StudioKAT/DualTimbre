# Dual Timbre Manual (EN)

## Overview

**Dual Timbre** is a dual-channel sound shaping tool that offers a modern take on the Buchla wavefolder circuit.  
The VCA response curve is continuously adjustable from exponential to linear.  
The TIMBRE and OFFSET knobs act as controls for the VCA’s opening amount when no patch cable is connected, and serve as attenuators when a CV signal is connected.  
The CV inputs are designed for 0 to +10V signals, and the audio inputs for ±5V (10V peak-to-peak).

## Functions of Each Section

![explanation](<../../Images/Dual Timbre_Ex.jpg>)

1. **TIMBRE**  
   Knob for adjusting the wavefolding amount.  
   Turning left sets it to minimum, turning right to maximum.  
   Also functions as an attenuator for the signal connected to CV A1.

2. **OFFSET**  
   Knob for adding an offset voltage to TIMBRE.  
   Turning left sets it to minimum, turning right to maximum.  
   Also functions as an attenuator for the signal connected to CV A2.  

3. **CURVE**  
   Knob for adjusting the VCA response curve.  
   Continuously variable from exponential to linear.

4. **CV A1**  
   CV input for TIMBRE.  
   Designed for 0 to +10V signals.

5. **CV A2**  
   CV input for OFFSET.  
   Designed for 0 to +10V signals.

6. **IN A**  
   Audio input jack.  
   Designed for ±5V signals.

7. **OUT A**  
   Audio output jack.
